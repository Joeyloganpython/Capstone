			<h2> Notes </h2>

			<p> * There are 3 dashboards, each of which can be access by pressing their assigned tab in the top of the visualization.
			<ul>

				<li> There is a correlation between counties that have a high rate of being flagged for risky opioid prescription and a high rate of overall opioid prescription (Tab 1)</li>

				<li> However, there is no relationship between risky prescription and overdose events (Tab 2)</li>

				<li> It might suggests that overdoses are likely to occur because Fentanyl is laced in other drugs, or someone takes more than they are used to by accident</li>

				<li> In Philadelphia, the number of police overdose events is low, and there is a high death rate (Tab 3) </li>

				<li> Philadelphia was the highest for EMS encounters while remaining in the middle for police encounters</li>

				<li> This may suggest that police let EMS handle those encounters or are not properly trained. Further, police may have the ability to arrive at a location faster</li>
