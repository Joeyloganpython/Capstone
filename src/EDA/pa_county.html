			<h2> Notes </h2>

			<ul>
				<li> In Philadelphia, the percentage of Naloxone administered, as wel as survival rate, were decreased in 2021. </li>

				<li> The drop in survival rate, might be related to the increase in Fentanyl arrests which suggests that Fentanyl was widely distributed. </li>

				<li> Luzerne County was also impacted by the Fentanyl spike. However, the survival rate remain around 80%, probably due to Naloxone widely administered. </li>
